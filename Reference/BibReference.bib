  abstract = {A major focus of research in recent years has been the development of algorithms for automated line smoothing. However, combination of the algorithms with other generalization operators is a challenging problem. In this research a key aim was to extend a snakes optimization approach, allowing displacement of lines, to also be used for line smoothing. Furthermore, automated selection of control parameters is important for fully automated solutions. An existing approach based on line segmentation was used to control the selection of smoothing parameters dependent on object characteristics. Additionally a new typification routine is presented, which uses the same preprocessed analysis for the segmentation of lines to find suitable candidates from curve bends. The typification is realized by deleting undersized bends and emphasizing the remaining curve bends. The main results of this research are two new algorithms for line generalization, where the importance of the line smoothing algorithm lies in the usage of a optimization approach which can also be used for line displacement.},

  abstract = {Robustness is about reducing the feasible set of a given nominal optimization problem by cutting ``risky'' solutions away. To this end, the most popular approach in the literature is to extend the nominal model with a polynomial number of additional variables and constraints, so as to obtain its robust counterpart. Robustness can also be enforced by adding a possibly exponential family of cutting planes, which typically leads to an exponential formulation where cuts have to be generated at run time. Both approaches have pros and cons, and it is not clear which is the best one when approaching a specific problem. In this paper we computationally compare the two options on some prototype problems with different characteristics. We first address robust optimization {\`a} la Bertsimas and Sim for linear programs, and show through computational experiments that a considerable speedup (up to 2 orders of magnitude) can be achieved by exploiting a dynamic cut generation scheme. For integer linear problems, instead, the compact formulation exhibits a typically better performance. We then move to a probabilistic setting and introduce the uncertain set covering problem where each column has a certain probability of disappearing, and each row has to be covered with high probability. A related uncertain graph connectivity problem is also investigated, where edges have a certain probability of failure. For both problems, compact ILP models and cutting plane solution schemes are presented and compared through extensive computational tests. The outcome is that a compact ILP formulation (if available) can be preferable because it allows for a better use of the rich arsenal of preprocessing/cut generation tools available in modern ILP solvers. For the cases where such a compact ILP formulation is not available, as in the uncertain connectivity problem, we propose a restart solution strategy and computationally show its practical effectiveness.},

The proposed Map Quality measure takes into account changes in all local objects (Shape Similarity), their neighborhoods (Location Similarity) and lastly across the entire map (Semantic Content Similarity). These three quality aspects measure the major generalization operators of simplification, relocation and selection, exaggeration and aggregation, collapse and typification. The three different aspects are combined using user-specified weights. Thus, the proposed framework supports the automatic choice of best alternative map according to preferences of the user or application.},

  abstract = {Manual cartographic generalization is a simultaneous process. However, most automatic approaches so far have been sequential; generalization operators are applied one at a time in a certain order. This has been the case both for model generalization (generalization of the conceptual model) and graphic generalization. Our research seeks to demonstrate that the graphic part of cartographic generalization can be formulated as an optimization problem and accordingly be solved in a single step. This paper deals with several issues regarding this optimization approach. Firstly, a set of appropriate analytical constraints for the generalization process is given, as well as rules for when to apply these constraints. In our approach, we are limited to formulating these constraints on point locations. Secondly, least-squares adjustment is proposed to find the optimal solution according to the constraints. Finally, the conjugate-gradients method is recommended for solving the normal equations. A prototype system for simultaneous graphic generalization has been implemented in C++, which communicates with a commercial map production system. Results from three tests of the prototype system are included in the paper.},

In this study, we evaluated whether we can predict map readability using analytical measures, both single measures and composites of measures. A user test was conducted regarding the perceived readability of a number of test map samples. Evaluations were then performed to determine how well single measures and composites of measures could describe the map readability. The evaluation of single measures showed that the amount of information was most important, followed by the spatial distribution of information. The measures of object complexity and graphical resolution were not useful for explaining the map readability of our test data. The evaluations of composites of measures included three methods: threshold evaluation, multiple linear regression and support vector machine. We found that the use of composites of measures was better for describing map readability than single measures, but we could not identify any major differences in the results of the three composite methods. The results of this study can be used to recommend readability measures for triggering and controlling the map generalization process of online maps.},

  abstract  = {We present an optimization approach to simplify sets of building footprints represented as polygons. We simplify each polygonal ring by selecting a subsequence of its original edges; the vertices of the simplified ring are defined by intersections of consecutive (and possibly extended) edges in the selected sequence. Our aim is to minimize the number of all output edges subject to a user-defined error tolerance. Since we earlier showed that the problem is NP-hard when requiring non-intersecting simple polygons as output, we cannot hope for an efficient, exact algorithm. Therefore, we present an efficient algorithm for a relaxed problem and an integer program (IP) that allows us to solve the original problem with existing software. Our IP is large, since it has $O(m^6)$ constraints, where $m$ is the number of input edges. In order to keep the running time small, we first consider a subset of only $O(m)$ constraints. The choice of the constraints ensures some basic properties of the solution. Constraints that were neglected are added during optimization whenever they become violated by a new solution encountered. Using this approach we simplified a set of 144 buildings with a total of 2056 edges in 4.1 seconds on a standard desktop PC; the simplified building set contained 762 edges. During optimization, the number of constraints increased by a mere 13 \%. We also show how to apply cartographic quality measures in our method and discuss their effects on examples.},

  abstract  = {The representation of vector data at variable scales has been widely applied in geographic information systems and map-based services. When the scale changes across a wide range, a complex generalization that involves multiple operations is required to transform the data. To present such complex generalization, we proposed a matrix model to combine different generalization operations into an integration. This study was carried on a set of river network data, where two operations, i.e., network pruning accompanied with river simplification, were hierarchically constructed as the rows and columns of a matrix. The correspondence between generalization operations and scale, and the scale linkage of multiple operations were also explicitly defined. In addition, we developed a vario-scale data structure to store the generalized river network data based on the proposed matrix. The matrix model was validated and assessed by a comparison with traditional methods that conduct generalization operations in sequence. It was shown that the matrix model enabled complex generalization with good generalization quality. Taking advantage of the corresponding vario-scale data structure, the river network data could be obtained at any arbitrary scale, and the vario-scale representation was achieved across a wide scale range.},

  abstract  = {Human perception of shape is based on visual parts of objects to a point that a single, significant visual part is sufficient to recognize the whole object. For example, if you see a hand in the door, you expect a human behind the door. Therefore, a cognitively motivated shape similarity measure for recognition applications should be based on visual parts. This cognitive assumption leads to two related problems of scale selection and subpart selection. To find a given query part Q as part of an object C, Q needs to have a correct size with regards to C (scale selection). Assuming that the correct size is selected, the part Q must be compared to all possible subparts of C (subpart selection). For global, contour-based similarity measures, scaling the whole contour curves of both objects to the same length usually solves the problem of scale selection. Although this is not an optimal solution, it works if the whole contour curves are `sufficiently' similar. Subpart selection problem does not occur in the implementation of global similarity measures.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new method for use in performing continuous scale transformations of linear features using Simulated Annealing-Based Morphing (SABM). This study addresses two key problems in the continuous generalization of linear features by morphing, specifically the detection of characteristic points and correspondence matching. First, an algorithm that performs robust detection of characteristic points is developed that is based on the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) model. Then, an optimal problem is defined and solved to associate the characteristic points between a coarser representation and a finer representation. The algorithm decomposes the input shapes into several pairs of corresponding segments and uses the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal matching. Simple straight-line trajectories are used to define the movements between corresponding points. The experimental results show that the SABM method can be used for continuous generalization and generates smooth, natural and visually pleasing linear features with gradient effects. In contrast to linear interpolation, the SABM method uses the simulated annealing technique to optimize the correspondence between characteristic points. Moreover, it avoids interior distortions within intermediate shapes and preserves the geographical characteristics of the input shapes.},

  abstract  = {We study the problem of morphing two polygons of building footprints at two different scales. This problem frequently occurs during the continuous zooming of interactive maps. The ground plan of a building footprint on a map has orthogonal characteristics, but traditional morphing methods cannot preserve these geographic characteristics at intermediate scales. We attempt to address this issue by presenting a turning angle function-based morphing model (TAFBM) that can generate polygons at an intermediate scale with an identical turning angle for each side. Thus, the orthogonal characteristics can be preserved during the entire interpolation. A case study demonstrates that the model yields good results when applied to data from a building map at various scales. During the continuous generalization, the orthogonal characteristics and their relationships with the spatial direction and topology are well preserved.},

  abstract  = {Geographic shape compactness is of concern in such contexts as urban morphology, political districting, and accuracy of enumeration unit values. The purpose of the present paper is to compare, categorize, and evaluate the various methods suggested for measuring compactness. Review of suggested compactness indices resulted in the identification of four categories, based upon: 1) perimeter-area measurement, 2) single parameters of related circles, 3) direct comparison to a standard shape, and 4) dispersion of elements of a shape's area. In all, eleven indices were calculated for a sample of U.S. counties and their frequency distributions were compared. Additionally, similarities and differences in the units of high, median, and low compactness were identified. Within each category, indices exhibited considerable similarity while significant differences were evident from category to category. These differences suggested variation in accuracy with which the indices measure compactness. It was hypothesized that measures based upon dispersion of elements of a shape's area would provide the most accurate measure because they consider the shape as a whole while the other indices do not. Determination of the accuracy with which each index measures compactness supported this hypothesis. Indices based upon direct comparison to a standard shape were found to be of similar accuracy and, therefore, also judged to be suitable compactness measures. Those measures based upon perimeter-area measurement and single parameters of related circles were determined to be considerably less accurate measures of compactness.},

We describe an algorithm to simplify the boundary lines after a map generalization operation (either a merge or a split operation) has been applied on a polygonal area and its neighbours. The simplification is performed simultaneously on the resulting boundaries of the new polygonal areas that replace the areas that were processed. As the simplification strategy has to keep the planar partition valid, we define what we consider to be a valid planar partition (among other requirements, no zero-sized areas and no unwanted intersections in the boundary polylines). Furthermore, we analyse the effects of the line simplification for the content of the data structures in which the planar partition is stored.},

  abstract  = {Fire is a natural component of many terrestrial ecosystems; however, uncontrolled intense wildfires can cause loss of human life and destruction of natural resources. Prescribed burning is a management activity undertaken for the purposes of both wildfire hazard reduction and the preservation of fire-adapted ecosystems. Achievement of prescribed burn targets is made difficult by operational constraints such as limited personnel, equipment and suitable weather for undertaking burning. Prescribed burn program implementation may benefit from efficiencies gained in undertaking larger burns. Here, we present a mixed-integer programming formulation for aggregation of prescribed burn units. The model minimizes the total prescribed burn perimeter requiring management, by aggregating existing `fundamental' burn units into larger compact and contiguous units or `clusters'. This problem is a special case of the `supervised regionalization' or the ` {\$}{\$}p{\$}{\$} p -regions problem'. The model's functionality is demonstrated on a test landscape and a number of extensions and implementation issues are discussed.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the properties of spreading activation and conceptual distance, the authors propose a metric, called distance, on the power set of nodes in a semantic net. Distance is the average minimum path length over all pairwise combinations of nodes between two subsets of nodes. Distance can be successfully used to assess the conceptual distance between sets of concepts when used on a semantic net of hierarchical relations. When other kinds of relationships, like `cause', are used, distance must be amended but then can again be effective. The judgements of distance significantly correlate with the distance judgements that people make and help to determine whether one semantic net is better or worse than another. The authors focus on the mathematical characteristics of distance that presents novel cases and interpretations. Experiments in which distance is applied to pairs of concepts and to sets of concepts in a hierarchical knowledge base show the power of hierarchical relations in representing information about the conceptual distance between concepts},

  abstract  = {Cartographic generalization aims to represent geographical information on a map whose specifications are different from those of the original database. Generalization often implies scale reduction, which generates legibility problems. To be readable at smaller scale, geographical objects often need to be enlarged, which generates problems of overlapping features or map congestion. To manage this problem with respect to buildings, we present a method of selection based on the typification principle that creates a result with fewer objects, but preserves the initial pattern of distribution. For this we use a graph of proximity on the building set, which is analysed and segmented with respect to various criteria, taken from gestalt theory. This analysis provides geographical information that is attached to each group of buildings such as the mean size of buildings, shape of the group, and density. This information is independent of scale. The information from the analysis stage is used to define methods to represent them at the target scale. The aim is to preserve the pattern as far as possible, preserve similarities and differences between the groups with regard to density, size and orientation of buildings. We present some results that have been obtained using the platform Strat{\`e}ge, developed in the COGIT laboratory at the Institut G{\'e}ographique National, Paris.},

In order to address the tradeoff between huge spatial data sets and small storage capacities and visualization screens, we propose to visualize only the information on the screen which adequately fits the current resolution. To realize this, we automatically decompose the generalization of an object into a sequence of elementary steps. From this, one can later easily obtain any desired generalization level by applying the appropriate subpart of the sequence. The method method does not only lead to smooth transitions between different object representations but also is useful for incremental transmission of maps through limited bandwidth channels.},

  abstract  = {Until now, road network generalization has mainly been applied to the task of generalizing from one fixed source scale to another fixed target scale. These actions result in large differences in content and representation, e.g., a sudden change of the representation of road segments from areas to lines, which may confuse users. Therefore, we aim at the continuous generalization of a road network for the whole range, from the large scale, where roads are represented as areas, to mid- and small scales, where roads are represented progressively more frequently as lines. As a consequence of this process, there is an intermediate scale range where at the same time some roads will be represented as areas, while others will be represented as lines. We propose a new data model together with a specific data structure where for all map objects, a range of valid map scales is stored. This model is based on the integrated and explicit representation of: (1) a planar area partition; and (2) a linear road network. This enables the generalization process to include the knowledge and understanding of a linear network. This paper further discusses the actual generalization options and algorithms for populating this data structure with high quality vario-scale cartographic content.},

  abstract = {Compatible meshes are isomorphic meshings of the interiors of two polygons having a correspondence between their vertices. Compatible meshing may be used for constructing sweeps, suitable for finite element analysis, between two base polygons. They may also be used for meshing a given sequence of polygons forming a sweep. We present a method to compute compatible triangulations of planar polygons, sometimes requiring extra (Steiner) vertices. Experimental results show that for typical real-life inputs, the number of Steiner vertices introduced is very small. However, having a small number of Steiner vertices, these compatible triangulations are usually not of high quality, i.e. they do not have well-shaped triangles. We show how to increase the quality of these triangulations by adding Steiner vertices in a compatible manner, using remeshing and mesh smoothing techniques. The total scheme results in high-quality compatible meshes with a small number of triangles. These meshes may then be morphed to obtain the intermediate triangulated sections of a sweep, if needed.},

  abstract = {Two planar triangulations with a correspondence between two vertex sets are compatible (isomorphic) if they are topologically equivalent. This work presents a simple and robust method for morphing two compatible planar triangulations with identical convex boundaries that locally preserves the intrinsic geometric properties of triangles throughout the morph. The method is based on the barycentric coordinates representation of planar triangulations, and thus, guarantees compatibility of all intermediate triangulations. The intrinsic properties are preserved by interpolating angles and edge lengths components of mean value barycentric coordinates, rather than interpolating the barycentric coordinates themselves. As a result, the method generates a natural-looking and guaranteed intersection-free morphing sequence.},

  abstract = {Building patterns are important features that should be preserved in the map generalization process. However, the patterns are not explicitly accessible to automated systems. This paper proposes a framework and several algorithms that automatically recognize building patterns from topographic data, with a focus on collinear and curvilinear alignments. For both patterns two algorithms are developed, which are able to recognize alignment-of-center and alignment-of-side patterns. The presented approach integrates aspects of computational geometry, graph-theoretic concepts and theories of visual perception. Although the individual algorithms for collinear and curvilinear patterns show great potential for each type of the patterns, the recognized patterns are neither complete nor of enough good quality. We therefore advocate the use of a multi-algorithm paradigm, where a mechanism is proposed to combine results from different algorithms to improve the recognition quality. The potential of our method is demonstrated by an application of the framework to several real topographic datasets. The quality of the recognition results are validated in an expert survey.},

This paper first reviews sales territory alignment models which have appeared in the marketing literature. A framework for sales territory alignment and several properties of a good sales territory alignment are developed in the course of the review. A general sales territory alignment model which accommodates these properties is developed. A solution procedure for the general model is presented. Finally, an actual implementation of the general model is described. The implementation provides a comparison of the general model with a similar model which has been frequently cited in the marketing literature.},

  abstract  = {Cartographic generalisation involves interaction between individual operators concerned with processes such as object elimination, detail reductions amalgamation, typification and displacement. Effective automation of these processes requires a means of maintaining knowledge of the spatial relationships between map objects in order to ensure that constraints of topology and of proximity are obeyed in the course of the individual generalisation transformations. Triangulated spatial models, based on the constrained Delaunay triangulation, have proven to be of particular value in representing the proximal and topological relations between map objects and hence in performing many of the essential tasks of fully automated cartographic generalisation. These include the identification of nearby objects; determination of the structure of space between nearby objects; execution of boundary simplification, merge and collapse operations; and the detection and resolution, by displacement, of topological inconsistencies arising from individual operators. In this paper we focus on the use of a triangulated model for operations specific to execution of merge operations between areal objects. The model is exploited to identify the regions of space between nearby objects and to execute merge operations in which the triangulation is used variously to adopt intervening space and to move adjacent rectangular objects to touch each other. Methods for updating the triangulation are described.},

Typification is a generalization operation that replaces a large number of similar objects by a smaller number of objects, while preserving the global structure of the object distribution. The typification approach is based on three processes. First the grid structures are detected based on the so-called relative neighborhood graph. Second the detected grid structures are regularized by a least square adjustment of an affine or Helmert transformation. The third process is the reduction or simplification of the grid structure, which can be done using the same affine or Helmert transformation approach.},
