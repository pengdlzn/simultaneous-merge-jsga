\rcommentnoskip{
The main idea of this paper (performing simultaneous smooth zooming in the context of SSC) is interesting, and is as far as I know a novel topic. Generally, the paper is good, and therefore my comments are on smaller details.
}
\textbf{Response.} Thanks for the positive comment.


\rcomment{
When starting reading the paper I missed a statement by the author in which way they wanted to perform the simultaneous generalization. Since working with e.g. SSC prohibit connected objects to be treated a choice has to be made of how to select the object. But the author do not really describe their ideal situation. This topic is, however, treated in the later part of the paper (page 11 row 33-44 (right) page 13 row 37-53) where they discuss the shortcoming of the proposed greedy algorithms if a too large value of the simultaneous parameter is used (which is a quite obvious effect). It would be good if the author could bring up this topic early in the paper (and later refer back to their vision when they know the result).
}
\textbf{Response.} 
We can start discussing our simultaneous generalization 
in the section of introduction.
\noticecomment{What is our ideal situation? 
Is it that the small areas distribute evenly on the map 
so that few objects will be blocked?}



\rcomment{
The weakest part of the paper is the description of the greedy algorithm (I might have made mistake while reading this part, but my impression is that this description really needs improvements).
}
\textbf{Response.} 
Thanks for the feedback!
We will improve our paper according to your comments 
(see our responses below).

\rcomment{
While reading it I got a bit uncertain of whether the greedy algorithm is in real time or if it is used in a preprocess. I might have missed something. Make sure this is clear.
}
\textbf{Response.} 
The greedy algorithm is used in a preprocess.
We will discuss this topic early in section ``A greedy algorithm''.

\rcomment{
State early in the description that 
the greedy algorithm aims at defining which events 
that should be triggered at a certain step. 
This becomes clear in the sentence starting with 
``The merging'' on page 7 row 59, 
but the reader needs this information earlier.
}
\textbf{Response.} 
We will discuss this topic early in section ``A greedy algorithm''.


\rcomment{
Page 6 row 43 right. Here you use $M_0$, while in start of Figure 6 $M_s$ is used.
}
\textbf{Response.} 
Do you mean page 6 row 25 right?
$M_0$ is a case of $M_s$, which should be fine.

\rcomment{
Page 6, row 42 right. Has the termed "blocked" been described earlier?
}
\textbf{Response.}
We used this term before, but we didn't describe it.
We will do so.

\rcomment{
Equation 1: You have to explain the symbols used 
refer to the ceiling function in the where-sentence after the equation.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will do so.

\rcomment{
Page 6 row 47 right. Is ``free area'' defined?
}
\textbf{Response.}
No, we will explain blocked areas and free areas earlier.

\rcomment{
Figure 5. In the caption you write that this is a process of 
``merging events for a step''. 
In the bottom of figure 5 it is stated "all the steps".
}
\textbf{Response.}
``merging events for a step'' is in the caption of Figure 6,
while ``all the steps'' is in Figure 5.


\rcomment{
Figure 6.  Should you really state the value of the simultaneous parameter here? 
The greedy algorithms is not dependent on the value setting.
}
\textbf{Response.}
No, we will not state the value here.

\rcomment{
Figure 1, page 2 row 43-48: 
A more detailed description of the ``Eater'' is required. 
It is not easy to understand what ``Eater'' is 
in the context of the graphic figure.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will add a more detailed description.

\rcomment{
Figure 3: Would recommend that
 three separate lists are used for the three workflow. 
 That is, instead of 3A-O it should be 3A1-3A3, 3B1-3B7 and 3C1-3C5.
  You also need to comment the figure p, q and r in the figure caption. 
  When reading the text here it is not known what these figures refer to. 
  This become not clear until a few pages later.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will improve it according to the comment.



\rcomment{
Page 8, row 39-42. Make a short note that 
some of the attributes are inherited 
(from the tGAPTopolObject superclass) .
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will make the short note.

\rcomment{
Page 8 row 42: 
Here you should comment the relationship
 between ``$s_\mathrm{low}$'' - ``$s_\mathrm{high}$'' 
 with the s value used in the flowchart in Figure 5.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will do that.

\rcomment{
Equation 2: Both $s$ and ``$s_\mathrm{high}$'' are input to the function. 
Not only ``$s_\mathrm{high}$''.
}
\textbf{Response.}
Both ``$s_\mathrm{high}$'' and ``$S_\mathrm{high}$'' are inputs.


\rcomment{
Table 1b: Is the value of fid 10 really correct? Could "smerge" be lower than "sslow"
}
\textbf{Response.}
No, the value was wrong. We have fixed the problem.

\rcomment{
Page 9, row 26 left (right). "shigh" is a vector. Normally a vector is written in bold (and not italics)
}
\textbf{Response.}
\noticecomment{Shall we change the notation?}.

\rcomment{
Figure 8. Is there any reference in the text to this figure?
}
\textbf{Response.}
No, we will add.

\rcomment{
Figure 10a: Do not get which are the overview map is of.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will mark it in Figure 9b.

\rcomment{
Page 12, row 56-60. Be more explicit that the sequential and simultaneous approach is compared here.
}
\textbf{Response.}
Sure, we will do that.


\rcomment{
Figure 11. For me this figure is not that interesting. The main contribution of the simultaneous approach is how the dynamics is improved. A figure that shows the difference at a certain point in time is not that interesting in my view (if I interpret this figure right). Consider to remove this figure.
}
\textbf{Response.}
\noticecomment{Shall we remove this figure?}.

\rcomment{
Page 13, row 41, right column. There is a grammatical error here "objects, We"
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will fix this error.

\rcomment{
Page 14 row 27-28. It is not easy to understand how the mthod of Ai would solve this issue.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will try to explain more.

\rcomment{
Page 14, row 10-14 right column. Here you bring up label placement on a few row. If you include labels you need to explain more about how labels should act in the context of smooth generalization. And also how the two references for label placement are connected to this approach. For me this part feels very uncertain and I would recommend the authors to remove these sentences.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will remove them.

\rcomment{
Page 14. Row 18-25 right column. Here the authors mention the approach of whether the foreground or background should be visible for zooming in and out. This is of course a topic, but hardly the main topic when it comes to integrating thematic information to the SSC. The harmonization of scale levels in the foreground and background (and object relationships) is a much more tricky problem that needs to be solved if the SSC can be used as a base map for thematic information.
}
\textbf{Response.}
\noticecomment{Shall we remove this point?} 

\rcomment{
Reference. Some references starting with S and T are not in alphabetic order.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will fix the problem.

\rcomment{
Appendix A. The tables need to more explained. Otherwise it is very hard to understand the SQL statements.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will explain more.

\rcomment{
Appendix. The numbering of equation should not be 8 etc. Rater B1 etc.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will fix it.

\rcommentnoskip{
The manuscript presented a simultaneous generalization method with progressive transformation effects. Using the example of land-use parcel merging explains the idea of progressive transformation process. The whole manuscript discussed a complete process including the basic idea, the algorithm process, the attached data and web coding source. The presented method is an innovation strategy in map generalization to reflect the detailed scale transformation and other temporal change. The following comments can be referenced.
}
\textbf{Response.} 
Thanks for the summary!

\rcomment{
The abstract writing needs to use more induction texts to summarize the main ideas of this method from a high level perspective, rather than detailed process description. The advantages and applications of this method needs to evaluate.
}
\textbf{Response.}
Sure, we will improve the abstract.

\rcomment{
The gradual operation of map generalization is the main idea in the manuscript. In the introduction it needs to discuss this question deeply. Jump from the concrete merging operation and from a common perspective discuss the concept gradual generalization. The characteristics, advantages, applications of this new method is expected to use more texts to describe. Suggest consider the generalization of temporal evolution phenomena, such as soil, flooding region.
}
\textbf{Response.}
\noticecomment{Should we mention 
the generalization of temporal evolution phenomena, such as soil, flooding region?}

We will try to discuss more deeply

\rcomment{
The progressive transformation in web generalization can be referenced citing some related papers.
}
\textbf{Response.}
Sure, we will cite those related papers.

\rcomment{
As for the polygon generalization, in section 2 you mentioned aggregation, merging and others. The difference of aggregation, amalgamation and merging needs to distinguish.
}
\textbf{Response.}
Sure, we will do that.

\rcomment{
In the section of methodology, reference TGAP, SSC by citation and miss some contents. Suggest describe these two models using detailed texts since they are important support in the manuscript.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will do that.

\rcomment{
The figure 4 needs to explain in detail. What is the difference between left and right? How to reflect the merging event in SSC?
}
\textbf{Response.}
We will add more details.

\rcomment{
As for the gradual merging operation, you mentioned several times in the manuscript. But how to realize in geometric process , how to triangulate and how to using triangle cell to gradually eating the neighbor, needs to use a proper figure to illustrate these processes. This question plays an important role in the manuscript.
}
\textbf{Response.}
We can borrow a figure from another paper.

\rcomment{
How to define the granularity in the gradual merging if considering the scale change range? The change granularity for the merging From 1:10K to 1:50K and 1:10K to 1:100K should be different, I think. Considers the time costs, a large scale change range needs to more time and correspondingly coarse details.
}
\textbf{Response.}
For a zooming operation, there is a relationship between scale and time.

\rcomment{
Based on GAP model, the minor areas need to arrange in a linear sequence according to the importance. If some are in the similar importance level, and may be neighbor to each other, how to process in your block and eating strategy?
}
\textbf{Response.}
They have to be merged one by one.
